# React components for Vanilla Framework
![CI](https://github.com/canonical/react-components/workflows/CI/badge.svg?branch=main)

This is a collection of components designed to be the way to consume [Vanilla Framework](http://vanillaframework.io) when using React.

 **[Storybook](https://canonical.github.io/react-components/)** contains component docs with usage instructions.


## Requirements

Canonical react components currently require that your build is configured with [sass-loader](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader) (or equivalent), to compile sass.

## Install

To use the [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@canonical/react-components) do:

```shell
yarn add @canonical/react-components
```

Or if you use NPM:

```shell
npm install @canonical/react-components
```

## Developing locally using this repository

You may wish to link this library directly to your projects while developing locally.

You can do this by cloning this repo to your local workspace:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/canonical/react-components
```

If you then drop into that folder and run:

```shell
yarn run link-packages
```

...this will add this project, `react` and `react-dom` to a local yarn registry.

Switching back to the project you are developing, run:

```shell
yarn install
yarn link react
yarn link react-dom
yarn link @canonical/react-components
```

...to pull the linked deps from the local registry. If you now run `yarn build-watch` in your `react-components` folder, your project should pick up any changes on refresh or hot module reload.

**Note:** When you're finished working locally - don't forget to go back and unlink:

```
cd react-components
yarn run unlink-packages
```
