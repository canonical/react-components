## Project info

Canonical `react-components` is developed with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), but built with `babel` and `@babel/preset-typescript`. Type declarations are generated post build with `tsc`.

## Pull Requests

Pull request titles need to follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification, which will be used by [semantic-release](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release) to determine if a release will be published on merging your pull request into the main branch. You can refer to this [FAQ](https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/support/faq#how-can-i-change-the-type-of-commits-that-trigger-a-release) for details regarding rules for triggering a release.

## Developing components with Storybook

You can run [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) locally to develop new components. You may also need to validate that they work with other projects, in which case see the instructions below.

Run Storybook with [dotrun](https://github.com/canonical/dotrun):

```shell
dotrun
```

Or directly with Yarn:

```shell
yarn install
yarn docs
```

And remember to `dotrun test` and `dotrun lint`.

## Using with another project that runs on yarn 3

Both projects will need to be running on the same machine/container.

In `react-components` run:

```shell
yarn clean
yarn install
yarn build
yarn build-watch
```

In your project run:

```shell
yarn clean
yarn install
yarn link path_to_react_components
```

At this point, you might get errors about mismatched versions of specific dependencies between `react-components` and your project. To fix these errors, change the versions of those dependencies in `react-components` to match the versions in your project. Once done, rerun the previously mentioned steps.

Finally, in your project, add the resolutions for `react` and `react-dom` to `package.json`. The added bit of code should be:

```
"resolutions": {
    "@canonical/react-components": "portal:path_to_react_components",
    "formik": "portal:path_to_react_components/node_modules/formik",
    "react": "portal:path_to_react_components/node_modules/react",
    "react-dom": "portal:path_to_react_components/node_modules/react-dom"
}
```

_**Note:** Before pushing changes to `@canonical/react-components`, don't forget to change the mismatched versions of dependencies in `react-components` to the ones before the change._

## Using with another project that runs on an older version of yarn

Both projects will need to be running on the same machine/container.

In `react-components` run:

```shell
dotrun link-package
```

You may want to watch and build files as you change them.

```shell
dotrun build-watch
```

This command links React to prevent [multiple copies of React being loaded](https://reactjs.org/warnings/invalid-hook-call-warning.html#duplicate-react).

In the project you're working on:

```shell
dotrun clean
dotrun exec yarn link "@canonical/react-components"
dotrun exec yarn link "react"
dotrun exec yarn install
dotrun
```

If using a monorepo you'll need to run those commands at the top level (not inside a workspace).

You'll then need to start you project with yarn, not `./run`.

Then when you're finished, in your project run:

```shell
dotrun exec yarn unlink react
dotrun exec yarn unlink "@canonical/react-components"
```

Then in `react-components` run:

```shell
dotrun unlink-package
```

If you do not wish do use dotrun then replace dotrun in the command above. Note that you must use dotrun or yarn on one project you must use the same command on the other project so that they both link the same node modules.

## Developing integration tests with cypress

### Running against a local storybook

Start storybook with:

```shell
PORT=<PORT> yarn docs
```

Start the interactive cypress environment with:

```
yarn cypress:open --env port=<PORT>
```

### Running cypress tests in CI

```shell
PORT=<PORT> yarn test-cypress
```
